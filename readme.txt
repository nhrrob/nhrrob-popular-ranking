## Configuration
### Plugin Settings
There are no settings. Just browse the Poplar Plugins menu in the dashboard.

### Customization
There is a search bar to provide username. You can provide any username to see the plugins of that author.

## Usage
### Popular Plugins Table
In the popular plugins table you can see a list of popular plugins ranked by WordPress. In this table we display rank, active installs, name, author, 5 stars and 1 star.
Also on each cache clear action we provide rank difference with useful coloring where red means decrease and green means increase. Blue means massive improvement in the rank. Also showing the same for 5 stars as well.

### Popular Plugins by 5 Stars Table
In the popular plugins by 5 stars table we rank all plugins based on the 5 stars count. This rank is not provided by WordPress. Instead we create a rank based on the current 5 stars of all plugins. In this way you get a clear idea of user satisfaction for each plugin.
